#Design Patterns (H1)
This repository contains examples of common design patterns implemented in various programming languages. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

#What are Design Patterns? (H2)
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather are general principles that can be applied to any system or application.

Design patterns can help improve software design by providing a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of how to solve common problems. They can also make code more modular, flexible, and maintainable by separating concerns and reducing code duplication.

#Examples (H2)
The following design patterns are included in this repository:

Factory Method: A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
Singleton: A creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to it.
Observer: A behavioral pattern that allows an object to notify other objects when its state changes, without coupling the objects together.
Decorator: A structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
Strategy: A behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Template Method: A behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
Each design pattern includes examples of how to implement it in Go.

#Contributing (H2)
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an example of a design pattern in a programming language that is not yet included in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your code follows the existing code style and formatting guidelines, and that any necessary tests have been added and passed.
